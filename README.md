# Data_incubator_challenge
This is a project proposal for data incubator challenge by Qi Hao.
The proposed project aims to find out the correlations between stock prices and news. 
At this stage, we focused on GOOG stock. We downloaded the historical stock prices of GOOG and scraped news articles from finance google website from April 2014 to April 2017. 
By analysing the stock prices dataset, we found out the trend of the prices in every 4 days, as shown in plot 1. 
By analysing the news articles occurred during the corresponding days, we found out words with the highest frequencies that cause rising or falling trend, as shown in plot 2. 
As a result, we found out that the stock price of GOOG goes up 4 days after the word "Google" occurred in news articles. The analysis system can be applied in different stocks and areas . 
In the future, the proposed project also aims to include Natural Language Processing techniques and Named Entity Recognition to further analyse the news data and find out more meaningful correlations between stock prices and news.
